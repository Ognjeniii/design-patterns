# Design patterns examples

Some examples for software design patterns. <br>
We can divide patterns into three different types:
### - Structural design patterns
    1. ADAPTER - Used for mapping between two systems which are not compatible.

### - Creational design patterns
    1. SINGLETON - Enusures that class has only one instace, and provides global access to it.
    2. FACTORY METHOD - Encapsulate object creation logic in a separate method (class), abstracting instantiation process.
    
### - Behavioral design patterns
    1. STRATEGY - Enables to encapsulate multiple algorithms or behaviors into separate classes, known as strategies.
    Allows a the behavior of an object to be selected dinymically at runtime.
